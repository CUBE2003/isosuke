Correct the following YAML to describe a software application based on the repository context. Fix any syntax errors: {errors}. Ensure Description.Name is a non-empty, specific project name derived from the repository, Type is appropriate (e.g., 'Web Application', 'API'), and components reflect the application structure. Avoid generic terms like 'Example System' or 'User Data'.
